	 Over the past years, procedurally generated content has become increasingly popular, especially in video games.
	 But the seed (the data used as input for the algorithm) for those procedural algorithms is almost always just a number.
 
	 Meanwhile, computer vision algorithms keep getting faster, stronger and smarter.
 
	 And so we decided to try and mix the two together.
 
	 In this poster, we will explain the design we had in mind, and how we implemented it.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	We wanted to allow the players to personnalize a bit their experience, by giving them a way to control, even only in a small way, the procedural generation of content.
	 
	The challenge was to find a way for our algorithm to procedurally generate an enjoyable and fun playable level, which the players would feel they have the control on, without giving them total control.
	
	Another challenge was to use OpenCV and Unreal Engine together.

  \indent TODO
  
  In our project, we used Unreal Engine 4 as game engine, and OpenCV 3.1 to process the video from which we want to extract data.
  
  Firstly, for the sake of simplicity, we used short videos (2 to 3 minutes), with a static point of view to get rid of the complexity of keeping track of the camera's movement.
  
  We process each frame of the video, trying to follow the motion of the elements we're tracking.
  
  \textbf{NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.}
